7,Our Christmas cactus is has already flowered!!,2020-12-17 21:40:24.07384+01,2020-12-17 21:40:24.07384+01,,0,3,13
8,Harvested my first indoor lemon today from a plant I bought back in January. It tasted like sunshine.,2020-12-17 21:45:10.905849+01,2020-12-17 21:45:10.905849+01,,0,3,14
9,"The other leaves are nice and green. The plant is still making new leaves, and the new vines are growing nicely. One leaf has gone fully yellow, the other (pictured) is starting to yellow from the middle.

Soil is well draining, I water about once a week, less if the soil still feels moist. Never been repotted, I only got it a few months ago. No fertilizer used yet.

Might be worth noting: those are the leaves furthest from the light. Would that make a difference?

Edit based on the pinned post: it''s on a high shelf in my studio, nowhere near a window. My apartment doesn''t get much natural light at all, so it''s all artificial light for the babies. Airflow should be okay, I air my studio out for 10 minutes every hour.",2020-12-17 21:46:10.791508+01,2020-12-17 21:46:10.791508+01,,0,3,15

13,Most of these are Romas. They didnâ€™t really start producing till the summer heat faded and now theyâ€™re just laden with fruit. Itâ€™s a shame.,2020-12-17 21:55:26.920347+01,2020-12-17 21:55:26.920347+01,,0,3,19
14,"I face this decision today.. I have several huge tomato plants Roma just dripping in fruit.. Was going to pick the biggest ones and use the paper bag to hope they ripen.. some will go to an attempt for fried green tomatoes...

20,"In the future, try yanking the whole plant out and hanging upside down in a garage or basement. Put a tarp under it to catch dirt and tomatoes. They will slowly ripen on the vine.

18,"Make a brine with 2% salt content. you can do this by weighing out in grams with a kitchen scale however much water you would need to have these covered in a jar and multiplying that weight in grams by .02. That will equal the amount of salt to mix in with the water you weighed.

Throw the tomatoes in jars as they are. (Better not to cut them as they''ll turn to mush.) And cover with the 2% salt brine. Repeat as needed.

I recommend putting a ball of plastic wrap to push the tomatoes down or filling them to the brim so the tomatoes are completely submerged in the salt brine and not exposed to the small pocket of oxygen at the top of the jar. The salt percentage in the mixture is what is allowing the good lactobacillus bacteria to thrive and the bad to not be able to. Oxygen encourages bacterial growth and if not protected by the salt brine theres more room for bacteria you don''t want mixed in to replicate.

When you''re done throw a lable and date on there so you know when to come back to them, and leave them on the kitchen counter or somewhere its ambient temperature.

I would check them in 2 weeks. By that time the fermentation process will be done converting most of the sugar in the tomatoes to lactic acid. Id continue to try them weekly to see the progression.

Use them on whatever you want. Great in salads or anything fresh. Salsas and sauces. Really versatile",2020-12-17 22:03:31.407775+01,2020-12-17 22:03:31.407775+01,17,0,3,19

23,Usually for me yellow leafs are a watering issue. I know it can also be zinc or nitrogen too- you can try adding coffee grounds to the soil.,2020-12-17 22:08:29.707234+01,2020-12-17 22:08:29.707234+01,9,0,3,15

30,"Have you been keeping it in the shade? They bloom profusely when you keep them in darkness for more than 12 hours everyday in a cool place.

34,"The problem is that they never get a chance to go into dormiency. Sooner or later your roses will die if they aren''t exposed to cold temperatures.
